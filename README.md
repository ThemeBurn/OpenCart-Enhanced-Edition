# OpenCart Enhanced Edition

## Overview

OpenCart Enhanced Edition (OCEE) is a fork  of the [OpenCart](https://github.com/opencart/opencart) project. It aims to keep maximum compatibility by adhering to the following principles:
 - All [official OpenCart commits](https://github.com/opencart/opencart/commits/master) are merged 
 - Direct changing of OpenCart core files is allowed for bug fixes and architectural improvements only
 - New features or changes that introduce potential compatibility breaks are implemented with ocmods
 - All third party extensions that are compatible with OpenCart should work with OCEE too

## Versioning

OCEE follows [the official OpenCart versioning scheme](https://github.com/opencart/opencart#versioning) with a postfix addition, indicating the fork's build number. For example: ``OpenCart Enhanced Edition  2.2.0.0+1.0.1`` means that you are using OCEE version 1.0.1, which is based on OpenCart version 2.2.0.0. 
 
The OCEE versions are released according to the [semver](http://semver.org/) standards.
